Completed a layflat e-commerce shoot for Haunted Starbucks at Knock Twice Studio, with careful post-production. Every detail was refined to look sharp, even up close, with a strong focus on perfecting the lighting and color. Special attention was given to properly treat the fur aspects of this product, as fur can often look unprofessional when edited poorly.
