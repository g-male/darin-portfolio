Editorial photoshoot for the Knock Twice Essential Collection, shot in our (at the time) favourite Raghouse, capturing the overwhelming chaos of thousands of pounds of used clothing. 

The massive piles of garments highlighted the scale of the often overlooked used clothing industry, surprising our customers and emphasizing our commitment to sustainability. The dramatic setting brought a powerful message to our audience.
