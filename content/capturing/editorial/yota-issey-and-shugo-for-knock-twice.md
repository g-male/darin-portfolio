Yota, Issey, and Shugo, shot and edited by me for the 2023 Knock Twice essentials line.

Shot in our Toronto studio. The studioâ€™s walls, filled with curated posters, vintage signs, and unique collectibles, created a vibrant backdrop that reflected our curating skills and hybrid-moodboard social media presence. This setting also offers insight into the inspiration behind our designs and design ethos, giving customers a deeper connection to our creative process.
