This photo was used to promote one of Knock Twice's open-studio events, where we, along with friends, vended our vintage and designer goods to the public. Building on the success of our previous video advertisement, we decided to continue the theme of the "Human Clothing Hanger."

The open-studio event was an opportunity for us and other vendors to showcase a curated selection of unique vintage and designer pieces. The "Human Clothing Hanger" theme highlighted our creative approach to fashion and marketing, encouraging visitors to engage with the idea of clothing and its presentation in a new way.

This theme, paired with the vibrant and dynamic atmosphere of our studio space, created an engaging and memorable experience for attendees. The promotional photo captured the essence of the event, combining eye-catching visuals with a thought-provoking concept, ensuring a successful turnout and positive reception from the public.
