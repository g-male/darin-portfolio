Used to promote one of Knock Twice's open-studio events, where we, along with friends, vended our vintage and designer goods to the public. Building on our previous video advertisement, we decided to continue the theme of the "Human Clothing Hanger."


The "Human Clothing Hanger" theme highlighted our creative approach to fashion and marketing, encouraging visitors to engage with the idea of clothing and its presentation in a new way.
