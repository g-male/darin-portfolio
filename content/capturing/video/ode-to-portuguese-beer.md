This video represents perfectly, a philosophy I haven't found a name for yet. 

The idea for this video came to me so quickly, it was so insignificant. Just another one of the hundreds  of stupid little ideas I'll typically have in a week. The difference with this one was, I immediately executed it to completion. 

My theory is that some of the best ideas are one of the ones that you'd normally dismiss 99% of the time because it doesn't seem radical enough, or you'd rather not expend the energy needed to make it happen. 

From start to finish I must've been done in 40 minutes. I directed my brother Liam with the exact camera angles I had imagined just 5 minutes prior, made a bootleg Kanye audio, and slapped some comically shitty PNG's on there, and wam- 63k on TikTok.
