The canvas this piece was created on, was taken from my next door neighbors curb back in 2018. She had begun painting some sort of nautilus shell and given up. 

It kicked around for a year in my closet until i used it as a prop for a video i made in university where i had to pretend i was spray painting something. Naturally i positioned the camera in a way where you could tell i was spraying, but weren't able to see my creation. So now the canvas had a half assed sea shell, and seemingly random red spray paint all over the place.

Fast forward 5 years later to early 2024, when i finally took this thing back out of my closet, and said: "fuck it." "This thing has been sitting around for so long, even if i fuck it up, what difference does it make." 

20 something minutes later i had made this. Its a recreation on an earlier drawing i did on a receipt weeks prior.
