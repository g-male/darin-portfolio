The A.I. "Aurascapes" series for THINKER was made to convey the aura or vibe of nostalgic scenes from the pastâ€”ideal for enjoying the specific cannabis strain that each ad promotes. 

Drawing on my extensive mood board, and rich library of physical media, I created a precise combination of keywords to achieve the vibe of vintage Japanese and Americana magazines.





The purpose of this ad campaign was to promote THINKER's current line of cannabis products to both existing consumers and potential customers. The target audience comprises younger individuals aged 19-39 who want to buy from a brand that is not only trustworthy and cool but also appreciates aesthetic taste, and clever marketing.





The campaign was notably well-received by both consumers and industry competitors.



On a personal level, this project made me realize that my extensive background in curation has significantly enhanced my ability for AI prompting.

Combining AI prompting with Photoshop, color grading, and type design has shown me that, with time and patience, almost any desired outcome is possible.
