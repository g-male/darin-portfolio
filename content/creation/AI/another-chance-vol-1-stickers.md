In 2022, I created a series of AI-generated stickers for an event to showcase and sell graphic tees from the clothing brand I formerly founded, Knock Twice. The event featured tees printed on hand-restored vintage shirts, sourced from massive clothing facilities known as "Raghouses." The unique atmosphere of a Raghouse, with thousands of pounds of clothing draped chaotically over every surface and workers sorting clothes into categories, inspired the event's aesthetic.

We aimed to bring the vibe of a Raghouse to our event by creating mosaics of tees across the floor, placing mini clothing bundles (known as bales) around the space, and draping additional loose articles of clothing throughout the venue. To complement this theme, I designed AI-generated stickers that resembled ancient Roman bust sculptures made out of used "rags." This innovative design perfectly tied together the event's aesthetic and theme, becoming a hit among customers who received a sticker with their purchase.

Creating these stickers in 2022, when AI-generated images were still relatively new, added an extra layer of difficulty to the project. The stickers not only enhanced the event's visual appeal but also provided a memorable and unique experience for attendees.
