A lot of the time I'm making collages, I take pride in knowing that I'm the first person to combine two things together. It's a very personal process. 1990's NBA cards, Dollar Store Super Mario Bros Stickers, and film photos from Asia in the 80's, it screams Darin to me. 

Made using found, and purchased objects. Postcard sized, (4" x 6").
