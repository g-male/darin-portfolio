A lot of the time I'm making collages, I take pride in knowing that the first person to combine two specific elements together. It's a very personal process. 1990's NBA, Super Mario Bros, and film photos from Asia in the 80's, it screams Darin to me. 

Made using found, and purchased objects. Postcard sized.
