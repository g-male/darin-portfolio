Made from old Arabic stamps, an old US stamp, a 44 year old Canadian penny, a chip from a credit card, a vintage Nike stamp I found on a golf course in Montreal, a portion of a Québécois ID I found in an alleyway behind an airbnb, a scrap piece of metal I found on the curb in Scarborough, and old magazine clippings.
