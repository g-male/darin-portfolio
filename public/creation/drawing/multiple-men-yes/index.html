                    <p>The canvas this piece was created on, was taken from my next door neighbors curb back in 2018. She had begun painting some sort of nautilus shell and given up.</p>
<p>It kicked around for a year in my closet until i used it as a prop for a video i made in university where i had to pretend i was spray painting something. Naturally i positioned the camera in a way where you could tell i was spraying, but weren&rsquo;t able to see my creation. So now the canvas had a half assed sea shell, and seemingly random red spray paint all over the place.</p>
<p>Fast forward 5 years later to early 2024, when i finally took this thing back out of my closet, and said: &ldquo;fuck it.&rdquo; &ldquo;This thing has been sitting around for so long, even if i fuck it up, what difference does it make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20 something minutes later i had made this. Its a recreation on an earlier drawing i did on a receipt weeks prior.</p>
