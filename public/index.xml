      <description>This video represents perfectly, a philosophy I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a name for yet.&#xA;The idea for this video came to me so quickly, it was so insignificant. Just another one of the hundreds of stupid little ideas I&amp;rsquo;ll typically have in a week. The difference with this one was, I immediately executed it to completion.&#xA;My theory is that some of the best ideas are one of the ones that you&amp;rsquo;d normally dismiss 99% of the time because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem radical enough, or you&amp;rsquo;d rather not expend the energy needed to make it happen.</description>

      <description>A very early version of Multiple Men.&#xA;A couple Juicy Ass IPA&amp;rsquo;s and boredom sparked this one. Up until this point i hadn&amp;rsquo;t spent much time working on Multiple Men, and after completing the last face on the page, it filled me with immense satisfaction, inspiring me to push the concept further. Thus making this a catalyst piece. Alcohol Marker on grid Paper [8.5 x 14]</description>

      <description>A lot of the time I&amp;rsquo;m making collages, I take pride in knowing that I&amp;rsquo;m the first person to combine two things together. It&amp;rsquo;s a very personal process. 1990&amp;rsquo;s NBA cards, Dollar Store Super Mario Bros Stickers, and film photos from Asia in the 80&amp;rsquo;s, it screams Darin to me.&#xA;Made using found, and purchased objects.

      <description>My birding goal of this trip was to get a nice shot of just one measly Glossy Ibis. Shortly after expressing my concern for completing said goal, a big flock of them came shooting by right above us. Thankfully, my extreme bird-photography skills and instincts kicked in and I was able to get this awesome composition of the species I had been seeking.&#xA;Shot in Olhão, Portugal.</description>

      <description>The A.I. &amp;ldquo;Aurascapes&amp;rdquo; series for THINKER was made to convey the aura or vibe of nostalgic scenes from the past—ideal for enjoying the specific cannabis strain that each ad promotes.&#xA;Drawing on my extensive mood board, and rich library of physical media, I created a precise combination of keywords to achieve the vibe of vintage Japanese and Americana magazines.&#xA;The purpose of this ad campaign was to promote THINKER&amp;rsquo;s current line of cannabis products to both existing consumers and potential customers.</description>

      <description>I threw a relatively large house-party for Halloween in 2023. I wanted it to be the talk of my peers for years to come, really impress people. So much so that I asked Thinker Cannabis to sponsor the house-party.&#xA;Thinker Cannabis obliged, and came through with a big ass bowl of pre rolls. All I had to do was make some content during the house party. The party ended up getting so out of control I spent the whole night roleplaying the Eye of Sauron in the hopes of minimizing damage created by the chaos.</description>

Initially, I took this photo out of curiosity to see if I could zoom in and see what the operator looked like, with no intention of ever using it for anything else.</description>

      <description>For the follow-up event to showcase and sell graphic tees from Knock Twice, I designed a special sticker that captured the essence and vibe of the event. This sticker was created by scanning elements from vintage magazines, then manipulating and positioning them to fit the aesthetic of our unique venue setup.&#xA;The main portion of the design features the eyes at the top half, representing the Knock Twice logo, while the large crowd at the bottom symbolizes the attendees of the event, commemorating the occasion perfectly.</description>

      <description>This photo was taken to promote Another Chance Vol. 2, an event emulating the unique Raghouse aesthetic and raising awareness about the issues of fast fashion. The event featured hand-restored vintage graphic tees sourced from massive clothing facilities known as Raghouses. At these facilities, thousands of pounds of clothing are draped chaotically over every surface. Our goal was to bring this eclectic vibe to the event, creating an immersive shopping experience for visitors and highlighting the enormous scale and overflow of used textiles that Raghouses manage.</description>
