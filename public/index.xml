      <description>A very early version of Multiple Men.&#xA;A couple Juicy Ass IPA&amp;rsquo;s and boredom sparked this one. Up until this point i hadn&amp;rsquo;t spent much time working on Multiple Men, and after completing the last face on the page, it filled me with immense satisfaction, inspiring me to push the concept further. Thus making this a catalyst piece. Alcohol Marker on grid Paper [8.5 x 14]</description>

      <description>My birding goal of this trip was to get a nice shot of just one measly Glossy Ibis. Shortly after expressing my concern for completing said goal, a big flock of them came shooting by right above us. Thankfully, my extreme bird-photography skills and instincts kicked in and I was able to get this awesome composition of the species I had been seeking.&#xA;Shot in Olhão, Portugal.</description>

      <description>The A.I. &amp;ldquo;Aurascapes&amp;rdquo; series for THINKER was crafted to convey the aura or vibe of nostalgic, perfect scenes from the past—ideal for enjoying the specific cannabis strain that each ad promotes. Drawing on my previous experience with AI, an extensive mood board, and a rich library of physical media, I created a precise combination of keywords to achieve the vibe of vintage Japanese and Americana magazines.&#xA;The visual style of these images is reminiscent of a cool vintage Japanese magazine advertisement, evoking the kind of scene that makes viewers think, &amp;ldquo;Whoa, that looks cool, I want to do that.</description>

      <description>This photo was taken by me months prior, and while brainstorming and going through material for the flyer, we came across some old telephoto pictures I had taken years earlier of a crane operator high up in his crane. Initially, I took this photo out of curiosity to see if I could zoom in and see what the operator looked like, with no intention of ever using it for anything else.</description>

      <description>Compositionally, this might be one of, if not my greatest bird pic. Look at how the tree line is reflected like a great pyramid, with its tip pointed straight at my absolute boy right there. That cormorant was definitely having a good day. Shot in Tavira, Portugal.</description>

      <description>For the follow-up event to showcase and sell graphic tees from Knock Twice, I designed a special sticker that captured the essence and vibe of the event. This sticker was created by scanning elements from vintage magazines, then manipulating and positioning them to fit the aesthetic of our unique venue setup.&#xA;The main portion of the design features the eyes at the top half, representing the Knock Twice logo, while the large crowd at the bottom symbolizes the attendees of the event, commemorating the occasion perfectly.</description>

      <description>This promotional photo was taken to promote Another Chance Vol. 2, an event celebrating the unique raghouse aesthetic and raising awareness about the issues of fast fashion. The event featured hand-restored vintage graphic tees sourced from massive clothing facilities known as raghouses. At these facilities, thousands of pounds of clothing are draped chaotically over every surface, with workers sorting through piles of used garments. Our goal was to bring this eclectic vibe to the event, creating an immersive shopping experience for visitors and highlighting the enormous scale and overflow of used textiles that raghouses manage.</description>

The &amp;ldquo;Human Clothing Hanger&amp;rdquo; theme highlighted our creative approach to fashion and marketing, encouraging visitors to engage with the idea of clothing and its presentation in a new way.</description>
