The dramatic setting brought a powerful message to our audience.</description>

      <description>This photo was taken by me months prior, and while brainstorming and going through material for the flyer, we came across some old telephoto pictures I had taken years earlier of a crane operator high up in his crane. Initially, I took this photo out of curiosity to see if I could zoom in and see what the operator looked like, with no intention of ever using it for anything else.</description>

      <description>This photo was used to promote one of Knock Twice&amp;rsquo;s open-studio events, where we, along with friends, vended our vintage and designer goods to the public. Building on the success of our previous video advertisement, we decided to continue the theme of the &amp;ldquo;Human Clothing Hanger.&amp;rdquo; This concept not only draws attention and is eye-catching, but it also stands out as something unique and thought-provoking.&#xA;The open-studio event was an opportunity for us and other vendors to showcase a curated selection of unique vintage and designer pieces.</description>

      <description>This promotional photo was taken to promote Another Chance Vol. 2, an event celebrating the unique raghouse aesthetic and raising awareness about the issues of fast fashion. The event featured hand-restored vintage graphic tees sourced from massive clothing facilities known as raghouses. At these facilities, thousands of pounds of clothing are draped chaotically over every surface, with workers sorting through piles of used garments. Our goal was to bring this eclectic vibe to the event, creating an immersive shopping experience for visitors and highlighting the enormous scale and overflow of used textiles that raghouses manage.</description>

      <description>For the follow-up event to showcase and sell graphic tees from Knock Twice, I designed a special sticker that captured the essence and vibe of the event. This sticker was created by scanning elements from vintage magazines, then manipulating and positioning them to fit the aesthetic of our unique venue setup.&#xA;The main portion of the design features the eyes at the top half, representing the Knock Twice logo, while the large crowd at the bottom symbolizes the attendees of the event, commemorating the occasion perfectly.</description>

      <description>In 2022, I created a series of AI-generated stickers for an event to showcase and sell graphic tees from the clothing brand I formerly founded, Knock Twice. The event featured tees printed on hand-restored vintage shirts, sourced from massive clothing facilities known as &amp;ldquo;Raghouses.&amp;rdquo; The unique atmosphere of a Raghouse, with thousands of pounds of clothing draped chaotically over every surface and workers sorting clothes into categories, inspired the event&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic.</description>

      <description>The A.I. &amp;ldquo;Aurascapes&amp;rdquo; series for THINKER was crafted to convey the aura or vibe of nostalgic, perfect scenes from the past—ideal for enjoying the specific cannabis strain that each ad promotes. Drawing on my previous experience with AI, an extensive mood board, and a rich library of physical media, I created a precise combination of keywords to achieve the vibe of vintage Japanese and Americana magazines.&#xA;The visual style of these images is reminiscent of a cool vintage Japanese magazine advertisement, evoking the kind of scene that makes viewers think, &amp;ldquo;Whoa, that looks cool, I want to do that.</description>

      <description>A very early version of Multiple Men.&#xA;A couple Juicy Ass IPA&amp;rsquo;s and boredom sparked this one. Up until this point i hadn&amp;rsquo;t spent much time working on Multiple Men, and after completing the last face on the page, it filled me with immense satisfaction, inspiring me to push the concept further. Thus making this a catalyst piece.</description>

      <description>The canvas this piece was created on, was taken from my next door neighbors curb back in 2018. She had begun painting some sort of nautilus shell and given up.&#xA;It kicked around for a year in my closet until i used it as a prop for a video i made in university where i had to pretend i was spray painting something. Naturally i positioned the camera in a way where you could tell i was spraying, but weren&amp;rsquo;t able to see my creation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I could illustrate a more innocent, joyful looking individual. Some of my best works are done super quickly with zero consideration or thought behind them. This is a prime example of what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. Clearly there was nothing else going on in my mind, and I let my hand and subconscious do all the work.</description>
